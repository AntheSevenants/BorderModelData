# BorderModelData

This repository contains all report data generated by the [Border Model](https://github.com/AntheSevenants/BorderModel). In addition, all R scripts used to process this data are also included. Due to size constraints, the CSV output files are split in files of 25 megabytes. To put these files back together, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the directory of the file you want to compose:  
	`cd data/contact_stage1`
2. Use the cat command to put all files back together:  
	`cat * > contact_stage1.csv`

## Bug

As mentioned in the [BorderModel repository](https://github.com/AntheSevenants/BorderModel), the output of the bulk simulation program sometimes juggles around column data. In the R scripts in this repository, this is reversed.
